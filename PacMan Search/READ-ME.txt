PROJECT:
A PacMan game implementation with a single Pacman agent that search algorithms to navigate the maze board, eat food pellets, and defeat the ghosts. search.py holds algorithms for depth first search, breadth first search, and A* search. searchAgents.py holds search-based agents.

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
UC Berkeley, CS188 - Artificial Intelligence
This course will introduce the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. A specific emphasis will be on the statistical and decision-theoretic modeling paradigm.

By the end of this course, you will have built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in fully informed, partially observable and adversarial settings. Your agents will draw inferences in uncertain environments and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures. Your machine learning algorithms will classify handwritten digits and photographs. The techniques you learn in this course apply to a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems and will serve as the foundation for further study in any application area you choose to pursue.
